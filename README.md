# House-Price-Prediction
In this approach to predicting house prices using a machine learning model, missing data in the dataset is addressed through simple imputation, where missing values are replaced with basic statistical measures like means or medians. The model itself employs linear regression, a method that establishes a linear relationship between house features (such as size, bedrooms, and location) and their corresponding prices. By training this model on a dataset with known house prices, it learns to make predictions for new houses. The success of the model is evaluated using metrics like mean squared error, providing insight into its predictive accuracy.
